# Pearson correlation

## Correlacion 

A correlation coefficient measures the degree of relationship or association generally existing between two random variables. It is not convenient to identify correlation with causal dependence, since, if there is a formal similarity between the two concepts, it cannot be deduced from this that they are analogous; indeed it is possible that there is a high correlation between two events and that, however, there is no cause or effect relationship between them; For example, when two events have some common cause, they can be highly associated and are not the cause of the other. It should be remembered that the coefficient fluctuates between -1 ≤ ρ ≤ 1.

## What is the Pearson correlation coefficient?

The Pearson Correlation Coefficient is a measure of the correspondence or linear relationship between two random quantitative variables. In simpler words it can be defined as an index used to measure the degree of relationship that two variables have, both quantitative.

Having two variables, the correlation facilitates estimates of the value of one of them, with knowledge of the value of the other variable.

This coefficient is a measure that indicates the relative situation of the events with respect to the two variables, that is, it represents the numerical expression that indicates the degree of correspondence or relationship that exists between the 2 variables. These numbers vary between limits of +1 and -1.


## How is it calculated?
To have a guide that allows:

* Establish the contiguous variation of the two variables
* Compare the different cases with each other

To do this, Pearson's correlation coefficient is used, defined as the covariance that occurs between two typified variables and is calculated with the following expression:
